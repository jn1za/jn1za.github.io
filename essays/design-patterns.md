## The Color Grading Experience

Color. An enhancing aspect of our every day that we may so subtly forget its impact on how the world is perceived, felt, or imagined.Ask a director, photographer, film enthusiast and cinematography amateur alike about color grading, and there is always some intricate “guide” or advice enticed in conversation.

As a participant of the latter, I can tell you I still don’t have it all figured out. When I take a clip from my camera and put it into editing software, the place I absolutely spend the most time running in circles is the color grading section. A small tint of blue—teal specifically, yes quite the cliche and ambitious for me to even achieve—, a lift of gamma for nostalgia, a little extra orange saturation, maybe some contrast for intensity?

To be honest, when I don't exactly have the concrete idea of the theme or the precise feeling or message for a video, color grading is like the form in the road to a million different ways to express the same moment, and equally, a million different ways to accidentally drift away into something completely different. I'll adjust a frame, see if it works for the next, then try to match the next cut... only to realize I suddenly created an entirely different aesthetic from what I initially believe I had figured out. Not to mention, coming back to it with a fresh set of eyes only to be astonished at the horrid attempt at harmony and the time it took to produce it. Yet again the approach changes. 

Frankly, the whole process is built on an idea and the approach to reach that vision. There are hundreds of heuristics that could satisfy it, and it often takes longer to decide on one than to actually apply correction to an ongoing workflow. Smaller edits in lighting or colors existing in the shot, or saturation levels added in post, can all produce the same theme, but the path there becomes tedious, and for an amateur like myself, easy to get lost in.

Fortunately, like a bands in human discussion, this desire to produce one's vision is universal. There are experts who design preset filters, teach workflows or 'formulas' to applying specific color changes, and others who build tools to ensure consistency. Such a tool, are filters.

##  Paths Already Carved

Want to post a picture with that specific aesthetic? Go into the preset effects in Instagram itself. 
Can't get the exact way something looked when you saw it in person? Find the filter that might just express the same thing you felt about it at the time. Some filters are built into applications or editing softwares and can be handmade or uploaded by other users, some filters come purchased as a lookup table (LUT), some are physical attachments to your camera. Suddenly, in all of these consstructions of already harmonious aesthetic solutions, the tasks is simply to choose one that adheres the specific aesthetic in your vision, and slightly tune it from the baseline to your needs. 

This is precisely what designs patterns are in software engineering. The problem is universal in time and space, so by the time it prompts itself to you, there were solutions are created and proven to work in the general case and can be reused as a baseline framework.

Similarly, when our team began designing TeamUHp! the vision was ultimately getting users connected by sharing their ideas and desires to contribute with one another. Many questions are prompted during this brainstorming. Should users message each other? How do you users know what skills to promote? Where can users find projects for them specifically? How about this feature? Maybe this feature too...? Perhaps the approach is going in circles.

With so many ways to think of a structure, ultimately, basing off of known structures that are actually used in popular applications and made for this use case got the project started. For instance, TeamUHp as a platform is centered around posting projects. The consistent design for attributes to apply to a project as such that all projects are easy for the end project-seeker to go through was facilitated through functions that create them based on a defined model. That way they all are processed the same way. Similarly, separating the abilities to preform actions to the site between admins and users are facilitated through an attirbute of roles for the user. 

## The Vision is the Goal

Much like color grading provides a baseline aesthetic, these patterns provide a baseline structure for software, that way, rather than dedicating time to optimizing the structure and solution, we can focus on the mission of the platform itself, the creativity, features, and user experience. Ultimately, everyone wants to fulfill a great idea into production, and by the end of that, the takeaway is the completion and contribution to some message, theme, and feeling in film and photo, and some practical, unifying, and community oriented goals in TeamUhp! 

That goes without saying however, that collaboration is bound to bring success. Though I have met some peers in this field, I have yet to truly experience a collaborative project or effort in software engineering. I want to be more engaged with the communities around me, such as campus resources, or even be more active with forums or channels where people share their work or recruit others to collaborate with.
