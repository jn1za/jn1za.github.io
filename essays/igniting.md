## First Fascination

Itâ€™s crazy to think that my daily use of technology and the mechanisms behind their workings was such an abstract mystery to me for so long. The first time such mysteries caught my attention enough to investigate was when I was in middle school. The family laptop suddenly seemed to perform slower and slower, and eventually run into issues frequently. While my experience prior to that had only been in video game jargon and broad-level understanding of the internet and its vast interconnectedness, the frustration I was met with when troubleshooting that computer also earned me a deeper look into how all of these intricate processes really function when I look beyond the user-end application. 

## Software Engineering is Empowering

Every educational or workforce experience I have encountered seems to grant me a new set of vision that I keep with me from that point on. In my first ever computer science class in high school, learning for loops, conditionals, and functions made me feel like I could draw a better picture of the actual logic behind a calculator, or even something larger like a feature in a video game. When I first learned networking protocols, rather than visualizing some obscure connection error or my ping statistics, I saw ports and hops and the telecommunication towers in between. When I became more adjusted with cybersecurity practices, the less I was paranoid about basic internet surfing or online messaging, and more assured in the bounds of possible attack surface and exploitation techniques. 

The field of technology, or even just computer science, is vast enough on its own. The more I learn and am exposed to different aspects of this field, the more I can see how all the operations I do in a day are interconnected, and how powerful it becomes to understand how they work on the low technical level. For software engineering in particular, a vision you have for a helpful tool or creative website can truly become a tangible creation. This is clearly evident in the ways that such Silicon Valley stars founded their origin story; creating something out of imagination and watching it grow in social influence, business, and productivity, all affecting something larger than just themselves.
