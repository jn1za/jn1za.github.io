## First Fascination

It’s crazy to think that my daily use of technology and the mechanisms behind their workings was such an abstract mystery to me for so long. The first time such mysteries caught my attention enough to investigate was when I was in middle school. The family laptop suddenly seemed to perform slower and slower, and eventually run into issues frequently. While my experience prior to that had only been in video game jargon and broad-level understanding of the internet and its vast interconnectedness, the frustration I was met with when troubleshooting that computer also earned me a deeper look into how all of these intricate processes really function when I look beyond the user-end application. 

## Software Engineering is Empowering

Every educational or workforce experience I have encountered seems to grant me a new set of vision that I keep with me from that point on. In my first ever computer science class in high school, learning for loops, conditionals, and functions made me feel like I could draw a better picture of the actual logic behind a calculator, or even something larger like a feature in a video game. When I first learned networking protocols, rather than visualizing some obscure connection error or my ping statistics, I saw ports and hops and the telecommunication towers in between. When I became more adjusted with cybersecurity practices, the less I was paranoid about basic internet surfing or online messaging, and more assured in the bounds of possible attack surface and exploitation techniques. 

The field of technology, or even just computer science, is vast enough on its own. The more I learn and am exposed to different aspects of this field, the more I can see how all the operations I do in a day are interconnected, and how powerful it becomes to understand how they work on the low technical level. For software engineering in particular, a vision you have for a helpful tool or creative website can truly become a tangible creation. This is clearly evident in the ways that such Silicon Valley stars founded their origin story; creating something out of imagination and watching it grow in social influence, business, and productivity, all affecting something larger than just themselves. 

## Building Skills with More Engagement

Since the field of this study is so vast, I intend to approach it with intention. I have found the value in learning by practice. In order to be an engineer that can adapt quickly or take initiative, intuition is the trait to build to get there. With personal projects, I could practice implementing more complicated code, understand the management it takes to complete a project, and work with a greater sense of purpose to fulfill the aim of the project. Simultaneously, it allows me to put some of my personality and my mission into the project that I create. I aim to have a lot more projects moving forward, and hope to elevate the scope in which I can create something by practicing more and more. 

That goes without saying however, that collaboration is bound to bring success. Though I have met some peers in this field, I have yet to truly experience a collaborative project or effort in software engineering. I want to be more engaged with the communities around me, such as campus resources, or even be more active with forums or channels where people share their work or recruit others to collaborate with. 

## A Section of This Tech World: Cybersecurity

These days, I am very much more involved in the Cybersecurity area of this vast field. When it comes to passion in the field, I can very much say I feel a great sense of purpose and an ability to help others who may be in need in this particular area. It is also to do with the relevance of cybersecurity and attacker threat in global affairs that gives a sense of mission. In these growing concerns, everybody needs cybersecurity. 

These days, I am looking at certifications to continue my learning with. I have been pretty fascinated with SIEMs and their powerful ability to query events. This may be particularly relevant, as I could visualize a future in cyber forensics. As such, I’d better get more hands on with networking practices, as the movies don’t do justice to the tedious operations it really takes to pen test, or “hack.” Though, connecting that back with software engineering and SIEMs, I would like to get more experience in what a SaaS for many security solutions looks like in the backend, or what it takes to engineer software in the context and priority in security. 

In an ironic twist, I had no idea I would even like cybersecurity as a speciality. In my very first internship, I had more so in mind the software engineering and programming aspect [of what I didn’t know at the time was a very vast field] of technology. Yet I would never have truly known until I experienced something new. While I don’t limit myself to very specific things quite yet, I hope that in my time as student, I can better explore these different areas and gauge the best or most ideal place I can position myself in this world, while also contributing to it purposefully and passionately.
