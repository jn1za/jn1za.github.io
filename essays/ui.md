## Strapping My Boots to Venture the World of Design

During this past week of ICS314 on HTML and UI design with Bootstrap 5, these modules have given me some of the best feelings about the skills I am building so far. 
Perhaps it is that the things that I am able to produce in code are becoming more and more visual in substance, and are growing in their interactiveness. As a computer science student whose courses have so far have had an emphasis on theory, the things that I have learned to create with UI design have given me far more confidence in the capacity there is to learn something new, more context towards this position of design for a developer. Additionally, despite all the happenings and integrated technologies of this modern age, I feel these newfound understandings have made something I encounter every moment of the day–websites–a lot less of a mystery. 

My first encounter with really looking over HTML was through experience in a SOC. While investigating potentially malicious sites, the F12 button never hurt to try and see if I could obtain information in the devtools panes. However, in truth, a lot of it seemed like obscure structures of text in such a raw form of code, that I didn’t quite get the value out of tracing the words. The first time I had really felt I was getting the idea of how designing a web page worked (at least at a broad level), was my first sandbox encounter with a fake Microsoft login page. I found it interesting to see how neat the site appeared to be, yet obvious in its lack of functionality that it was a spoofed credential farmer; the idea that anyone, anywhere, anyhow can develop simply create such a thing, and at the same time, use the power of a well known design to fool the human mind. Such an encounter prompted to me the importance of being well-rounded in all areas of computer science, even for a position that is specific to security. Truth be told, upon the assignment “E36: Your Choice with Bootstrap 5,” when selecting a page to recreate, my first thought was to make my own intuitive attempt at the fake Microsoft page, yet that posed trivial moral dispositions to anyone who would stumble upon it. In irony (and in light of Cybersecurity Awareness Month!) I had instead recreated the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) homepage.

*Hmm… Try to guess! Which is the real CISA page?*
*(Answer key is in the devtools!)*

That assignment had used Bootstrap 5, and though it was initially a challenge to learn, the ease of use with bootstrap compared to raw HTML was considerable, and likely contributed greatly in the confidence I had gained in the ability to create a menu bar or grid of nav-links quickly and intuitively!
I had initially encountered raw HTML in a silly situation. When building the first essay on E6: Professional Portfolio, I had changed the essay templates to HTML and tried to learn how I was supposed to format my paragraphs to documentation. Truly, I was dazed and confused as to how my peers were uploading their essays in HTML, yet not one peep as to what syntax to use when we haven’t learned design yet! Incidentally, I learned how to break pages, paragraphs, source and float images through that little mistake. It felt very much a tedious pain to wrap every line, wondering why it looks strange when I push the changes, yet such an experience had in retrospect, enlightened me on the ease of such frameworks to abstract the difficulty. 

Shortly after the WoD on UI Design with Frameworks, I had gone into work and happened to walk right into a conversation on analyzing the front end of another potentially malicious site.  Seeing suspicious structure of the javascript file and joining the discussion, it clicked in my head in that moment, that I could seriously and minutely know exactly what was being referenced in the analyses, such as elements, iframes, obfuscation with CSS, and such, as if my mind had suddenly turned on some automatic translation that made me follow along with the point being conversed precisely. Beyond just understanding the way a website is designed and being able to break down a webpage that sits in front of me, now I am able to engage in the very technical aspects behind it. 

In the context of all of this, I am very excited to see where we will go with these topics moving forward. How can I connect the front-end page to cater to users’ interactions, then utilize server and network configuration and databases in the backend to build some usable applications. The world of tech is gradually becoming less mysterious to me, and my excitement to actively participate grows deeper and deeper!
