## Strapping My Boots to Venture the World of Design
During this past week of ICS314 on HTML and UI design with Bootstrap 5, these modules have given me some of the best feelings about the skills I am building so far. 
Perhaps it is that the things that I am able to produce in code are becoming more and more visual in substance, and are growing in their interactiveness. As a computer science student whose courses have so far have had an emphasis on theory, the things that I have learned to create with UI design have given me far more confidence in the capacity there is to learn something new, more context towards this position of design for a developer. Additionally, despite all the happenings and integrated technologies of this modern age, I feel these newfound understandings have made something I encounter every moment of the day–websites–a lot less of a mystery. 

My first encounter with really looking over HTML was through experience in a SOC. While investigating potentially malicious sites, the F12 button never hurt to try and see if I could obtain information in the devtools panes. However, in truth, a lot of it seemed like obscure structures of text in such a raw form of code, that I didn’t quite get the value out of tracing the words. The first time I had really felt I was getting the idea of how designing a web page worked (at least at a broad level), was my first sandbox encounter with a fake Microsoft login page. I found it interesting to see how neat the site appeared to be, yet obvious in its lack of functionality that it was a spoofed credential farmer; the idea that anyone, anywhere, anyhow can develop simply create such a thing, and at the same time, use the power of a well known design to fool the human mind. Such an encounter prompted to me the importance of being well-rounded in all areas of computer science, even for a position that is specific to security. Truth be told, upon the assignment “E36: Your Choice with Bootstrap 5,” when selecting a page to recreate, my first thought was to make my own intuitive attempt at the fake Microsoft page, yet that posed trivial moral dispositions to anyone who would stumble upon it.
