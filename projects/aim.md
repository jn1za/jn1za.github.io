A team of Class of 2023 High School seniors. We bonded together to invite our school's very own alumni to share their stories with the current students of Leilhua High School. This video [yes, that's my voice!] declares our mission was the first video to release prior to each individual interview's release. 

## Project A.I.M.
###### Leilehua High School Seniors of 2023

At some point before we graduate, we need to create serious future plans. That means deciding whether you’re going to college or not, which colleges to apply for, and what career to pursue. All of this is so that eventually, we can get a good job and build a fulfilling life.

But the struggle is real. You may not really know what you want to do after high school, sometimes you’re unsure of your strengths or passions, and you might not know how to turn your passions into a career. Staying motivated, facing failure, and taking risks can feel overwhelming. At times, you may not even know what you’re aiming for at all.

We are Team AIM – Alumni. Inspiring. Motivating. We reached out to several alumni of Leilehua High School to hear their stories. They shared their experiences achieving success, the wisdom and strategies they’ve learned, and their personal philosophies for thriving in life and work.

These alumni offered insight into overcoming obstacles, striving for achievements, and following passions with resilience. Their words serve as a guide for upcoming graduates and future generations, showing how to navigate the challenges after high school with courage and determination.

The AIM project is also a reminder of the endless possibilities for success in our future. These alumni, who have attained significant accomplishments in life and careers, were at one point no more than students at Leilehua High School. Just like us.
